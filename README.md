# PyQTGeneralTools

A PyQt Project using a combination of 20+ Pyqt Tools. This project is mainly to be used as a testing ground of adding new tools (without the aid of PyQT Designer). 

New tools will be added in the PyQT testing them out 
Tools from this project will be used in other from this point onwards.


As of right now the following tools are in play
- file manager
- menu system 
- window geometry settings 
- Text editor 
  - Built in with font picker as well as colour picker
- Design scheme mechanic for window
- Mulitple methods of quitting the aplication 
- the ability to open local files into window editor (local drive capabilities)
- the ability to save a text document into local drive
- Amongst small other UI elements

** Current problem with the Text editor: certain computers are unable to switch back to the window without the text editor, selective decision
** dead pixels arise when using the text editor (arising from the preceeding window that has a bunch of buttons.UI and the like)
